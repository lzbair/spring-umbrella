# Reactor: #   
Event-based (contrast with thread-based) pattern for handling service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler by one or more input.The service handler then demultiplexes the incoming requests and dispatches them synchronously to the associated request handlers.

Huge transaction processing services of banking sector  
Share trade business where share prices changes simultaneously
